### üß≠ 3. User Flow / Grading Instructions

Provide a clear walkthrough for testing your app - here's an example:

1. Visit the homepage at: [URL here]
2. Login with a normal user.
3. Try feature A (describe what it does).
4. Logout and log in as admin.
5. Test feature B (admin-specific function).
6. Navigate to page X and try action Y.

Feel free to number the steps. Be as specific as possible. This helps ensure your app is tested fairly and accurately.

Add any additional notes or testing considerations here:


### ‚úÖ Examples:

- We also implemented a basic dark mode toggle in the settings menu. It‚Äôs not part of the main flow but feel free to test it.
- On mobile, the chat interface occasionally overlaps with the footer. This is a known issue and we focused on desktop experience first.
- You can reset the database using the `/admin/reset` endpoint (only available for admin users). Use with caution ‚Äî it deletes all data.
- The homepage displays a list of upcoming events. If you‚Äôre testing this after June 21, the list might be empty unless you manually add events.
