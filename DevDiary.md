## Day Nr. 1 - [June 8th, 2025]
            - ✅ What I worked on today: creating the Visual Prototype based on my first design mockups in Figma, creating all necessary components and figuring out how to structure the frontend.
            - 💡 Biggest learning: Components are necessary for effective workflow
            - ❌ Biggest mistake/blocker: thinking I could do it faster without components and then having to start over :(
            - 📌 Notes for tomorrow: finish the Prototype!

## Day Nr. 2 - [June 9th, 2025]
            - ✅ What I worked on today: finishing the Figma prototype!;setting up the GitLab repository, creating a new react-vite project; setting up the database, connecting to the database; testing backend and frontend with the Socials.js Page, which displays the users I input to the inkforge_users datatable
            - 💡 Biggest learning: how to run the backend and frontend at the same time and how to connect the two (making two separate directories and deploying them in two separate terminals)
            - ❌ Biggest mistake/blocker: forgetting to put something in the index.html and wondering why nothing was being displayed for a solid hour...
            - 📌 Notes for tomorrow: creating the projects datatable and then getting started on the frontend (components, navigating, interactions, styling, etc...)
