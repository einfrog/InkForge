            - 📌 Notes for tomorrow:

## Day Nr. 1 - [June 8th, 2025]
            - ✅ What I worked on today: creating the Visual Prototype based on my first design mockups in Figma, creating all necessary components and figuring out how to structure the frontend.
            - 💡 Biggest learning: Components are necessary for effective workflow
            - ❌ Biggest mistake/blocker: thinking I could do it faster without components and then having to start over :(
            - 📌 Notes for tomorrow: finish the Prototype!

## Day Nr. 2 - [June 9th, 2025]
            - ✅ What I worked on today: finishing the Figma prototype!;csetting up the GitLab repository, creating a new react-vite project; setting up the database, connecting to the database; testing backend and frontend with the Socials.js Page, which displays the users I input to the inkforge_users datatable
            - 💡 Biggest learning: how to run the backend and frontend at the same time and how to connect the two (making two separate directories and deploying them in two separate terminals)
            - ❌ Biggest mistake/blocker: forgetting to put something in the index.html and wondering why nothing was being displayed for a solid hour...
            - 📌 Notes for tomorrow: creating the projects datatable and then getting started on the frontend (components, navigating, interactions, styling, etc...)

## Day Nr. 3 - [June 10th]
            - ✅ What I worked on today: finish the figma prototype; routes for "/", "/login" and "/socials", try to figure out the login functionality. managed to fix login functionality late at night :D
            - 💡 Biggest learning: how to navigate folders
            - ❌ Biggest mistake/blocker: not being able to figure out how to do login. i was trying to stitch together FWOC and SSC but i was unsuccessful and wasted about 3 hours on login.
            - 📌 Notes for tomorrow: make header with login and logout buttons

## Day Nr. 4 - [June 11th]
            - ✅ What I worked on today: created the header component with login and logout buttons, implemented admin authorization and added the ability to register users. added dropdown to profile button in header that allows you to view your profile or log out when logged in, and allows you to login or register when not logged in. added userdetail page, profile page that displays details of logged in user, added protected routes.
            - 💡 Biggest learning: how to properly work with routes  and methods (this time, will probably have to relearn it a bunch more times)
            - ❌ Biggest mistake/blocker: confusing routes (/inkforge_users vs /users) stitching together code and trying to make it work; typos, not importing things the right way (require vs import)
            - 📌 Notes for tomorrow: automatically log in after registration, delete and update users (either admin and the logged in user can edit/delete their profile, nobody else); maybe get started on projects datatable and frontend :>
